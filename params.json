{"name":"the Transportation Enlightenment Authority","tagline":"part of the Peoples' Democratic Roadway Party","body":"##Our Philosophy\r\nBefore we became drivers, motorists, cyclists, skateboardists, runners, jumpers, skippers, captains, and underwater basket weavers, we all began as one thing: human. Despite how we transport our fleshly bodies around in this holographic universe, our conscious essence goes nowhere. Time to act like it! \r\n\r\n\r\n##Our Actions\r\nWe are self-policing because we are self-actualized. When we see poor transit behavior in ourselves or others, we make mention of it and urge its correction. When we see excellent transit behavior, we likewise do not let it go unmentioned - we celebrate it! Like begets like, and we like each other.\r\n\r\n##Our Vision\r\nWe see the roadway as it is: another slat of wood in the metaphorical world stage. All the world's a stage, and your actions on the road are not separate from your life and your identity. We do not let our nervous system rule our behavior; we engage with higher thinking centers and recognize that all life moves and we must move with it - the vehicle does not supersede the intelligence of the life that created it. A bigger car does not triumph over a smaller car, who does not triumph over a cyclist, who does not triumph over a pedestrian. We are all equals. On the common roadway that we all share - that is, our need to transport our bodies from place to place - we respect all users as ourselves.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
